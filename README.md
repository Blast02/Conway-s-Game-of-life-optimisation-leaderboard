# 🚀 Game of Life Optimisation Leaderboard  

This repository is a **personal training project** to:  
- Improve my programming skills 👨‍💻  
- Explore **Python optimization techniques** ⚡  
- Learn the basics of **low-level languages** like C, C++, or Rust 🦀  

At first, it was simply a way for me to move beyond Python and try something new.  
My first version of the game in Python was made in less than a day, without AI or any form of optimization. I just wanted to have a basic reference implementation.

## 🏆 Project Goal  
I want to keep track of two **leaderboards** for Conway’s Game of Life:  

1. **Python Leaderboard** → Compare different Python optimizations.  
2. **Multi-language Leaderboard** → Compare how fast different programming languages can run the simulation.

## 📊 Python Leaderboard  

### Rules  
- Must be implemented in **Python**.  
- Grid size: **1280 × 720** with a cell size of **10 then 2 pixels**.  
- The game **must render to the screen** (e.g. with `pygame`) → ❌ terminal output not allowed.  
- Initial grid must be generated using **NumPy random integer generator** with **seed = 1337**.  
- The grid must **wrap around (no walls)** 🔄.

## 🌍 Multi-language Leaderboard  

### Rules  
- Grid size: **1280 × 720** with a cell size of **10 then 5 then 2 pixels**.  
- The game **must render to the screen** → ❌ terminal output not allowed.  
- Initial grid must be generated with a **random integers generator** using **seed = 1337**.  
- The grid must **wrap around (no walls)** 🔄.  

### Multi-language leaderboard  

| Author | Version / Technique | Language | ⏱️ Time 10,000 steps (10px) | ⏱️ Time 10,000 steps (5px) | ⏱️ Time 10,000 steps (2px) |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|

## 🤝 How to Contribute  

Want to add your version to the leaderboard? Here’s how:  

1. **Fork** this repository.  
2. Add your implementation in a new folder with a clear name (e.g. `python_numpy_optim` or `rust_base`).  
3. Run your implementation with the rules described above and measure execution time.  
4. Update the corresponding **leaderboard table** in this README with your results.  
5. Submit a **pull request** 🚀.

👉 The idea is not just competition, but also **learning from different implementations** and seeing how far optimization can go.
